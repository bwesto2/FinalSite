I am Blake Weston, an aspiring data scientist. I am currently enrolled as a Masters Candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago pursuing an MS in Business Analytics. My background includes a BS in Finance. I have professional experience as a senior financial analyst but looking to pivot into a more data-centric role.

I love programming so I built this website to demonstrate my interests and to display some of my qualifications and projects. Please have a look around and feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities in data science and machine learning.
